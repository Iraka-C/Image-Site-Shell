# Image Site Shell
## Introduction
A simple shell for some image resource sites.<br/>
[You can try it here](https://iraka-c.github.io/Image-Site-Shell/index.html)<br/>
Click on the image to download the original image file.<br/>
Right click on the image to show original image file. (Experimental)<br/><br/>
Currently support:<br/>
* yande.re<br/>
* Konachan<br/>
* Danbooru<br/>
<br/>

By recomposing the UI, an easier environment to browse pictures is provided, and you needn't worry about finding the source URL, blocking ads or manually switching pages.

## Cross Origin Resources
Image Site Shell uses YQL Ajax service for cross-origin data fetching, therefore proxies are not necessary for this shell and all operations can be operated at the browser front-end.
